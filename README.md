# Data_Science_Notes

These are my personal hand written notes in Machine learning, Deep learning and Python. I have included separate pdf files with notes in these areas. Mainly the notes include complete Machine Learning and Deep Learning Course of Andrew Ng|Coursera|Stanford along with notes of Recommendation System based on collabrative filtering and SVD approach.
These will certainly help you in a quick revision of all the topics covered by several platforms in Data Science.
